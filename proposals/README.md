# Proposals

Lightweight implementation ideas for Plain packages.

These are considered living documents. Some implementation details have been thought through, but they haven't been tried yet so here they sit! They are here because we haven't had the need or time yet to fully implement and release them.

These are primarily written with the help of Claude Code.

## Format

One file per proposal: `<package>-<feature-name>.md`

```markdown
# plain-<package>: Feature Name

- Implementation point
- Another point
- Why it matters (optional)

## Optional Section

- Details if needed
```

## Usage

- Add new proposals as separate files
- Delete files when implemented or abandoned
- Git history keeps old ideas
