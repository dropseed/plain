### What's changed

- Removed `AuthenticationMiddleware` - authentication is now handled through request-based functions instead of middleware ([154ee10](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/154ee10))
- Replaced `request.user` attribute with `get_request_user(request)` function and `{{ get_current_user() }}` template global ([154ee10](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/154ee10))
- `AuthViewMixin` now provides a `self.user` property for accessing the authenticated user in views ([154ee10](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/154ee10))
- Renamed `get_user` to `get_request_user` in the public API ([154ee10](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/154ee10))

### Upgrade instructions

- Remove `plain.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware` from your `MIDDLEWARE` setting
- In views, use `AuthViewMixin` for access to `self.user` instead of `self.request.user`
- The default for `login_required` in `AuthViewMixin` is now `False`, so explicitly set `login_required = True` if needed
- Replace `request.user` with `get_request_user(request)` in code outside of `AuthViewMixin` views
- In templates, replace `{{ request.user }}` with `{{ user }}` (from `AuthViewMixin`) or with `{{ get_current_user() }}`
