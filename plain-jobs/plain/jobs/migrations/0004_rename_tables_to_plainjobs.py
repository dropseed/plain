# Manual transition from plain-worker (plainworker) to plain-jobs (plainjobs)
#
# If upgrading from plain.worker, run this SQL command BEFORE running migrations:
#
# plain models db-shell -- -c "INSERT INTO plainmigrations (app, name, applied) SELECT 'plainjobs', name, applied FROM plainmigrations WHERE app = 'plainworker' ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;"
#
# Then run: plain migrate
# Then run: plain migrate --prune (to clean up old plainworker records)
#
# Step 1: Rename tables from plainworker_* to plainjobs_*
