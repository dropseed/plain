# Plain

**A web framework for building products with Python.**

The Plain framework consists of a core `plain` package, and a collection of additional first-party packages that can be installed by choice.

The quickest way to get started is to clone one of the [starter kits](https://plainframework.com/start/), but you can always install `plain` directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/plain/) and start from scratch.

With the core `plain` package you can build an app that:

- Matches [URL patterns](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain/plain/urls/README.md) to Python [views](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain/plain/views/README.md)
- Handles [HTTP requests and responses](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain/plain/http/README.md)
- Renders [HTML templates](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain/plain/templates/README.md) with Jinja
- Processes user input via [forms](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain/plain/forms/README.md)
- Has a [CLI interface](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain/plain/cli/README.md)
- Serves static [assets](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain/plain/assets/README.md) (CSS, JS, images)
- Can be modified with [middleware](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain/plain/middleware/README.md)
- Integrates first-party and third-party [packages](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain/plain/packages/README.md)
- Has a [preflight check system](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain/plain/preflight/README.md)

With the official Plain ecosystem packages you can:

- Integrate a full-featured [database ORM](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain-models/plain/models/README.md)
- Use a built-in [user authentication](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain-auth/plain/auth/README.md) system
- [Lint and format code](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain-code/plain/code/README.md)
- Run a [database-backed cache](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain-cache/plain/cache/README.md)
- [Send emails](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain-email/plain/email/README.md)
- Streamline [local development](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain-dev/plain/dev/README.md)

- Run tests with [pytest](https://plainframework.com/docs/plain-pytest/plain/pytest/README.md)
