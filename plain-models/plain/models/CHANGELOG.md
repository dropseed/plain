# plain-models changelog

## [0.34.1](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.1) (2025-06-23)

### What's changed

- Fixed Markdown bullet indentation in the 0.34.0 release notes so they render correctly ([2fc81de](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/2fc81de)).

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.34.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.0) (2025-06-23)

### What's changed

- Switched to a single `DATABASE` setting instead of `DATABASES` and removed `DATABASE_ROUTERS`. A helper still automatically populates `DATABASE` from `DATABASE_URL` just like before ([d346d81](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/d346d81)).
- The `plain.models.db` module now exposes a `db_connection` object that lazily represents the active database connection. Previous `connections`, `router`, and `DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS` exports were removed ([d346d81](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/d346d81)).

### Upgrade instructions

- Replace any `DATABASES` definition in your settings with a single `DATABASE` dict (keys are identical to the inner dict you were previously using).
- Remove any `DATABASE_ROUTERS` configuration – multiple databases are no longer supported.
- Update import sites:
    - `from plain.models import connections` → `from plain.models import db_connection`
    - `from plain.models import router` → (no longer needed; remove usage or switch to `db_connection` where appropriate)
    - `from plain.models.connections import DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS` → (constant removed; default database is implicit)
