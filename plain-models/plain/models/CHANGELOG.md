# plain-models changelog

## [0.35.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.35.0) (2025-07-07)

### What's changed

- Added the `plain models list` CLI command which prints a nicely formatted list of all installed models, including their table name, fields, and originating package. You can pass package labels to filter the output or use the `--app-only` flag to only show first-party app models ([1bc40ce](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/1bc40ce)).
- The MySQL backend no longer enforces a strict `mysqlclient >= 1.4.3` version check and had several unused constraint-handling methods removed, reducing boilerplate and improving compatibility with a wider range of `mysqlclient` versions ([6322400](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/6322400), [67f21f6](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/67f21f6)).

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.34.4](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.4) (2025-07-02)

### What's changed

- The built-in `on_delete` behaviors (`CASCADE`, `PROTECT`, `RESTRICT`, `SET_NULL`, `SET_DEFAULT`, and the callables returned by `SET(...)`) no longer receive the legacy `using` argument. Their signatures are now `(collector, field, sub_objs)` ([20325a1](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/20325a1)).
- Removed the unused `interprets_empty_strings_as_nulls` backend feature flag and the related fallback logic ([285378c](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/285378c)).

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.34.3](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.3) (2025-06-29)

### What's changed

- Simplified log output when creating or destroying test databases during test setup. The messages now display the test database name directly and no longer reference the deprecated "alias" terminology ([a543706](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/a543706)).

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.34.2](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.2) (2025-06-27)

### What's changed

- Fixed PostgreSQL `_nodb_cursor` fallback that could raise `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'alias'` when the maintenance database wasn't available ([3e49683](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/3e49683)).
- Restored support for the `USING` clause when creating PostgreSQL indexes; custom index types such as `GIN` and `GIST` are now generated correctly again ([9d2b8fe](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/9d2b8fe)).

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.34.1](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.1) (2025-06-23)

### What's changed

- Fixed Markdown bullet indentation in the 0.34.0 release notes so they render correctly ([2fc81de](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/2fc81de)).

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.34.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.0) (2025-06-23)

### What's changed

- Switched to a single `DATABASE` setting instead of `DATABASES` and removed `DATABASE_ROUTERS`. A helper still automatically populates `DATABASE` from `DATABASE_URL` just like before ([d346d81](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/d346d81)).
- The `plain.models.db` module now exposes a `db_connection` object that lazily represents the active database connection. Previous `connections`, `router`, and `DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS` exports were removed ([d346d81](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/d346d81)).

### Upgrade instructions

- Replace any `DATABASES` definition in your settings with a single `DATABASE` dict (keys are identical to the inner dict you were previously using).
- Remove any `DATABASE_ROUTERS` configuration – multiple databases are no longer supported.
- Update import sites:
    - `from plain.models import connections` → `from plain.models import db_connection`
    - `from plain.models import router` → (no longer needed; remove usage or switch to `db_connection` where appropriate)
    - `from plain.models.connections import DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS` → (constant removed; default database is implicit)
