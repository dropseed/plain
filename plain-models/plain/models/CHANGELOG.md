# plain-models changelog

## [0.44.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.44.0) (2025-09-19)

### What's changed

- PostgreSQL backup restoration now drops and recreates the database instead of using `pg_restore --clean`, providing more reliable restoration by terminating active connections and ensuring a completely clean database state ([a8865fe](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/a8865fe5d6))
- Added `_meta` type annotation to the `Model` class for improved type checking and IDE support ([387b92e](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/387b92e08b))

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.43.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.43.0) (2025-09-12)

### What's changed

- The `related_name` parameter is now required for ForeignKey and ManyToManyField relationships if you want a reverse accessor. The `"+"` suffix to disable reverse relations has been removed, and automatic `_set` suffixes are no longer generated ([89fa03979f](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/89fa03979f))
- Refactored related descriptors and managers for better internal organization and type safety ([9f0b03957a](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/9f0b03957a))
- Added docstrings and return type annotations to model `query` property and related manager methods for improved developer experience ([544d85b60b](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/544d85b60b))

### Upgrade instructions

- Remove any `related_name="+"` usage - if you don't want a reverse accessor, simply omit the `related_name` parameter entirely
- Update any code that relied on automatic `_set` suffixes - these are no longer generated, so you must use explicit `related_name` values
- Add explicit `related_name` arguments to all ForeignKey and ManyToManyField definitions where you want reverse access (e.g., `models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="articles")`)
- Consider removing `related_name` arguments that are not used in practice

## [0.42.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.42.0) (2025-09-12)

### What's changed

- The model manager interface has been renamed from `.objects` to `.query` ([037a239](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/037a239ef4))
- Manager functionality has been merged into QuerySet, simplifying the architecture - custom QuerySets can now be set directly via `Meta.queryset_class` ([bbaee93](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/bbaee93839))
- The `objects` manager is now set directly on the Model class for better type checking ([fccc5be](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/fccc5be13e))
- Database backups are now created automatically during migrations when in DEBUG mode ([c8023074](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/c8023074e9))
- Removed several legacy manager features: `default_related_name`, `base_manager_name`, `creation_counter`, `use_in_migrations`, `auto_created`, and routing hints ([multiple commits](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/compare/plain-models@0.41.1...037a239ef4))

### Upgrade instructions

- Replace all usage of `Model.objects` with `Model.query` in your codebase (e.g., `User.objects.filter()` becomes `User.query.filter()`)
- If you have custom managers, convert them to custom QuerySets and set them using `Meta.queryset_class` instead of assigning to class attributes (if there is more than one custom manager on a class, invoke the new QuerySet class directly or add a shortcut on the Model using `@classmethod`)
- Remove any usage of the removed manager features: `default_related_name`, `base_manager_name`, manager `creation_counter`, `use_in_migrations`, `auto_created`, and database routing hints
- Any reverse accessors (typically `<related_model>_set` or defined by `related_name`) will now return a manager class for the additional `add()`, `remove()`, `clear()`, etc. methods and the regular queryset methods will be available via `.query` (e.g., `user.articles.first()` becomes `user.articles.query.first()`)

## [0.41.1](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.41.1) (2025-09-09)

### What's changed

- Improved stack trace filtering in OpenTelemetry spans to exclude internal plain/models frames, making debugging traces cleaner and more focused on user code ([5771dd5](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/5771dd5))

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.41.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.41.0) (2025-09-09)

### What's changed

- Python 3.13 is now the minimum required version ([d86e307](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/d86e307))
- Removed the `earliest()`, `latest()`, and `get_latest_by` model meta option - use `order_by().first()` and `order_by().last()` instead ([b6093a8](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/b6093a8))
- Removed automatic ordering in `first()` and `last()` queryset methods - they now respect the existing queryset ordering without adding default ordering ([adc19a6](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/adc19a6))
- Added code location attributes to database operation tracing, showing the source file, line number, and function where the query originated ([da36a17](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/da36a17))

### Upgrade instructions

- Replace usage of `earliest()`, `latest()`, and model `Meta` `get_latest_by` queryset methods with equivalent `order_by().first()` or `order_by().last()` calls
- The `first()` and `last()` methods no longer automatically add ordering by `id` - explicitly add `.order_by()` to your querysets or `ordering` to your models `Meta` class if needed

## [0.40.1](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.40.1) (2025-09-03)

### What's changed

- Internal documentation updates for agent commands ([df3edbf0bd](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/df3edbf0bd))

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.40.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.40.0) (2025-08-05)

### What's changed

- Foreign key fields now accept lazy objects (like `SimpleLazyObject` used for `request.user`) by automatically evaluating them ([eb78dcc76d](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/eb78dcc76d))
- Added `--no-input` option to `plain migrate` command to skip user prompts ([0bdaf0409e](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/0bdaf0409e))
- Removed the `plain models optimize-migration` command ([6e4131ab29](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/6e4131ab29))
- Removed the `--fake-initial` option from `plain migrate` command ([6506a8bfb9](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/6506a8bfb9))
- Fixed CLI help text to reference `plain` commands instead of `manage.py` ([8071854d61](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/8071854d61))

### Upgrade instructions

- Remove any usage of `plain models optimize-migration` command - it is no longer available
- Remove any usage of `--fake-initial` option from `plain migrate` commands - it is no longer supported
- It is no longer necessary to do `user=request.user or None`, for example, when setting foreign key fields with a lazy object like `request.user`. These will now be automatically evaluated.

## [0.39.2](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.39.2) (2025-07-25)

### What's changed

- Fixed remaining `to_field_name` attribute usage in `ModelMultipleChoiceField` validation to use `id` directly ([26c80356d3](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/26c80356d3))

- Added note about `PrimaryKeyField()` replacement requirement for migrations ([70ea931660](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/70ea931660))

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.39.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.39.0) (2025-07-22)

### What's changed

- Models now use a single automatic `id` field as the primary key, replacing the previous `pk` alias and automatic field system ([4b8fa6a](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/4b8fa6a))
- Removed the `to_field` option for ForeignKey - foreign keys now always reference the primary key of the related model ([7fc3c88](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/7fc3c88))
- Removed the internal `from_fields` and `to_fields` system used for multi-column foreign keys ([0e9eda3](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/0e9eda3))
- Removed the `parent_link` parameter on ForeignKey and ForeignObject ([6658647](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/6658647))
- Removed `InlineForeignKeyField` from forms ([ede6265](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/ede6265))

- Cleaned up unused code in ForeignKey and fixed ForeignObjectRel imports ([b656ee6](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/b656ee6))

### Upgrade instructions

- Replace any direct references to `pk` with `id` in your models and queries (e.g., `user.pk` becomes `user.id`)
- Remove any `to_field` arguments from ForeignKey definitions - they are no longer supported
- Remove any `parent_link=True` arguments from ForeignKey definitions - they are no longer supported
- Replace any usage of `InlineForeignKeyField` in forms with standard form fields
- `models.BigAutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True)` need to be replaced with `models.PrimaryKeyField()` in migrations

### What's changed

- Added `get_or_none()` method to QuerySet which returns a single object matching the given arguments or None if no object is found ([48e07bf](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/48e07bf))

### Upgrade instructions

## [0.37.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.37.0) (2025-07-18)

### What's changed

- Added OpenTelemetry instrumentation for database operations - all SQL queries now automatically generate OpenTelemetry spans with standardized attributes following semantic conventions ([b0224d0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/b0224d0))
- Database operations in tests are now wrapped with tracing suppression to avoid generating telemetry noise during test execution ([b0224d0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/b0224d0))

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.35.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.35.0) (2025-07-07)

### What's changed

- Added the `plain models list` CLI command which prints a nicely formatted list of all installed models, including their table name, fields, and originating package. You can pass package labels to filter the output or use the `--app-only` flag to only show first-party app models ([1bc40ce](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/1bc40ce)).
- The MySQL backend no longer enforces a strict `mysqlclient >= 1.4.3` version check and had several unused constraint-handling methods removed, reducing boilerplate and improving compatibility with a wider range of `mysqlclient` versions ([6322400](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/6322400), [67f21f6](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/67f21f6)).

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.34.4](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.4) (2025-07-02)

### What's changed

- The built-in `on_delete` behaviors (`CASCADE`, `PROTECT`, `RESTRICT`, `SET_NULL`, `SET_DEFAULT`, and the callables returned by `SET(...)`) no longer receive the legacy `using` argument. Their signatures are now `(collector, field, sub_objs)` ([20325a1](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/20325a1)).
- Removed the unused `interprets_empty_strings_as_nulls` backend feature flag and the related fallback logic ([285378c](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/285378c)).

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.34.3](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.3) (2025-06-29)

### What's changed

- Simplified log output when creating or destroying test databases during test setup. The messages now display the test database name directly and no longer reference the deprecated "alias" terminology ([a543706](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/a543706)).

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.34.2](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.2) (2025-06-27)

### What's changed

- Fixed PostgreSQL `_nodb_cursor` fallback that could raise `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'alias'` when the maintenance database wasn't available ([3e49683](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/3e49683)).
- Restored support for the `USING` clause when creating PostgreSQL indexes; custom index types such as `GIN` and `GIST` are now generated correctly again ([9d2b8fe](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/9d2b8fe)).

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.34.1](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.1) (2025-06-23)

### What's changed

- Fixed Markdown bullet indentation in the 0.34.0 release notes so they render correctly ([2fc81de](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/2fc81de)).

### Upgrade instructions

- No changes required

## [0.34.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain-models@0.34.0) (2025-06-23)

### What's changed

- Switched to a single `DATABASE` setting instead of `DATABASES` and removed `DATABASE_ROUTERS`. A helper still automatically populates `DATABASE` from `DATABASE_URL` just like before ([d346d81](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/d346d81)).
- The `plain.models.db` module now exposes a `db_connection` object that lazily represents the active database connection. Previous `connections`, `router`, and `DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS` exports were removed ([d346d81](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/d346d81)).

### Upgrade instructions

- Replace any `DATABASES` definition in your settings with a single `DATABASE` dict (keys are identical to the inner dict you were previously using).
- Remove any `DATABASE_ROUTERS` configuration – multiple databases are no longer supported.
- Update import sites:
    - `from plain.models import connections` → `from plain.models import db_connection`
    - `from plain.models import router` → (no longer needed; remove usage or switch to `db_connection` where appropriate)
    - `from plain.models.connections import DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS` → (constant removed; default database is implicit)
