# plain changelog

## [0.82.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain@0.82.0) (2025-10-29)

### What's changed

- The `DEFAULT_RESPONSE_HEADERS` setting can now be a callable that accepts a request argument, enabling dynamic header generation per request ([cb92905834](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/cb92905834))
- Added `request.csp_nonce` cached property for generating Content Security Policy nonces ([75071dcc70](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/75071dcc70))
- Simplified the preflight command by moving `plain preflight check` back to `plain preflight` ([40c2c4560e](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/40c2c4560e))

### Upgrade instructions

- If you use `plain preflight check`, update to `plain preflight` (the `check` subcommand has been removed for simplicity)
- If you use `plain preflight check --deploy`, update to `plain preflight --deploy`

## [0.81.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain@0.81.0) (2025-10-22)

### What's changed

- Removed support for category-specific error template fallbacks like `4xx.html` and `5xx.html` ([9513f7c4fa](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/9513f7c4fa))

### Upgrade instructions

- If you have `4xx.html` or `5xx.html` error templates, rename them to specific status code templates (e.g., `404.html`, `500.html`) or remove them if you prefer the plain HTTP response fallback

## [0.80.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain@0.80.0) (2025-10-22)

### What's changed

- CSRF failures now raise `SuspiciousOperation` (HTTP 400) instead of `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403) ([ad146bde3e](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/ad146bde3e))
- Error templates can now use category-specific fallbacks like `4xx.html` or `5xx.html` instead of the generic `error.html` ([716cfa3cfc](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/716cfa3cfc))
- Updated error template documentation with best practices for self-contained `500.html` templates ([55cea3b522](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/55cea3b522))

### Upgrade instructions

- If you have a `templates/error.html` template, instead create specific error templates for each status code you want to customize (e.g., `400.html`, `403.html`, `404.html`, `500.html`). You can also create category-specific templates like `4xx.html` or `5xx.html` for broader coverage.

## [0.79.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain@0.79.0) (2025-10-22)

### What's changed

- Response objects now have an `exception` attribute that stores the exception that caused 5xx errors ([0a243ba89c](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/0a243ba89c))
- Middleware classes now use an abstract base class `HttpMiddleware` with a `process_request()` method ([b960eed6c6](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/b960eed6c6))
- CSRF middleware now raises `PermissionDenied` instead of rendering a custom `CsrfFailureView` ([d4b93e59b3](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/d4b93e59b3))
- The `HTTP_ERROR_VIEWS` setting has been removed ([7a4e3a31f4](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/7a4e3a31f4))
- Standalone `plain-changelog` and `plain-upgrade` executables have been removed in favor of the built-in commands ([07c3a4c540](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/07c3a4c540))
- Standalone `plain-build` executable has been removed ([99301ea797](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/99301ea797))
- Removed automatic logging of all HTTP 400+ status codes for cleaner logs ([c2769d7281](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/c2769d7281))

### Upgrade instructions

- If you have custom middleware, inherit from `HttpMiddleware` and rename your `__call__()` method to `process_request()`:

    ```python
    # Before:
    class MyMiddleware:
        def __init__(self, get_response):
            self.get_response = get_response

        def __call__(self, request):
            response = self.get_response(request)
            return response

    # After:
    from plain.http import HttpMiddleware

    class MyMiddleware(HttpMiddleware):
        def process_request(self, request):
            response = self.get_response(request)
            return response
    ```

- Remove any custom `HTTP_ERROR_VIEWS` setting from your configuration - error views are now controlled entirely by exception handlers
- If you were calling `plain-changelog` or `plain-upgrade` as standalone commands, use `plain changelog` or `plain upgrade` instead
- If you were calling `plain-build` as a standalone command, use `plain build` instead

### Upgrade instructions

- Update any chores from decorated functions to class-based chores:

    ```python
    # Before:
    @register_chore("group")
    def chore_name():
        """Description"""
        return "Done!"

    # After:
    from plain.chores import Chore, register_chore

    @register_chore

- Remove `gunicorn` from your project dependencies if you added it separately (it's now built into plain)

### Upgrade instructions

- Update any uses of the `plain preflight` command to `plain preflight check`, and remove the `--database` and `--fail-level` options which no longer exist
- Custom preflight checks should be class based, extending `PreflightCheck` and implementing the `run()` method
- Preflight checks need to be registered with a custom name (ex. `@register_check("app.my_custom_check")`) and optionally with `deploy=True` if it should run in only in deploy mode
- Preflight results should use `PreflightResult` (optionally with `warning=True`) instead of `preflight.Warning` or `preflight.Error`
- Preflight result IDs should be descriptive strings (e.g., `models.lazy_reference_resolution_failed`) instead of numeric codes
- `PREFLIGHT_SILENCED_CHECKS` setting has been replaced with `PREFLIGHT_SILENCED_RESULTS` which should contain a list of result IDs to silence. `PREFLIGHT_SILENCED_CHECKS` now silences entire checks by name.

## [0.58.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain@0.58.0) (2025-08-19)

### What's changed

- Complete rewrite of CSRF protection using modern Sec-Fetch-Site headers and origin validation ([955150800c](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/955150800c))
- Replaced CSRF view mixin with path-based exemptions using `CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS` setting ([2a50a9154e](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/2a50a9154e))
- Renamed `HTTPS_REDIRECT_EXEMPT` to `HTTPS_REDIRECT_EXEMPT_PATHS` with leading slash requirement ([b53d3bb7a7](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/b53d3bb7a7))
- Agent commands now print prompts directly when running in Claude Code or Codex Sandbox environments ([6eaed8ae3b](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/6eaed8ae3b))

### Upgrade instructions

- Remove any usage of `CsrfExemptViewMixin` and `request.csrf_exempt` and add exempt paths to the `CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS` setting instead (ex. `CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS = [r"^/api/", r"/webhooks/.*"]` -- but consider first whether the view still needs CSRF exemption under the new implementation)
- Replace `HTTPS_REDIRECT_EXEMPT` with `HTTPS_REDIRECT_EXEMPT_PATHS` and ensure patterns include leading slash (ex. `[r"^/health$", r"/api/internal/.*"]`)
- Remove all CSRF cookie and token related settings - the new implementation doesn't use cookies or tokens (ex. `{{ csrf_input }}` and `{{ csrf_token }}`)

## [0.57.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain@0.57.0) (2025-08-15)

### What's changed

### Upgrade instructions

### Upgrade instructions

- Update any scripts or documentation that call `plain urls …`:
    - Replace `plain urls --flat` with `plain urls list --flat`
- If you invoke preflight checks in CI or locally:
    - Replace `plain preflight --database <alias>` (or multiple aliases) with the new boolean flag: `plain preflight --database`
- In `settings.py` migrate to the new database configuration:

    ```python
    # Before
    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "plain.backends.sqlite3",
            "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
        }
    }

    # After
    DATABASE = {
        "ENGINE": "plain.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
    }
    ```

    Remove any `DATABASES` and `DATABASE_ROUTERS` settings – they are no longer read.
