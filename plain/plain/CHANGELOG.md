# plain changelog

## [0.59.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain@0.59.0) (2025-08-22)

### What's changed

- Added new `APP_NAME` setting that defaults to the project name from `pyproject.toml` ([1a4d60e](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/1a4d60e787))
- Template views now validate that `get_template_names()` returns a list instead of a string ([428a64f](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/428a64f8cc))
- Object views now use cached properties for `.object` and `.objects` to improve performance ([bd0507a](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/bd0507a72c))
- Improved `plain upgrade` command to suggest using subagents when there are more than 3 package updates ([497c30d](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/497c30d445))

### Upgrade instructions

- In object views, `self.load_object()` is no longer necessary as `self.object` is now a cached property.

## [0.58.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain@0.58.0) (2025-08-19)

### What's changed

- Complete rewrite of CSRF protection using modern Sec-Fetch-Site headers and origin validation ([955150800c](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/955150800c))
- Replaced CSRF view mixin with path-based exemptions using `CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS` setting ([2a50a9154e](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/2a50a9154e))
- Renamed `HTTPS_REDIRECT_EXEMPT` to `HTTPS_REDIRECT_EXEMPT_PATHS` with leading slash requirement ([b53d3bb7a7](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/b53d3bb7a7))
- Agent commands now print prompts directly when running in Claude Code or Codex Sandbox environments ([6eaed8ae3b](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/6eaed8ae3b))

### Upgrade instructions

- Remove any usage of `CsrfExemptViewMixin` and `request.csrf_exempt` and add exempt paths to the `CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS` setting instead (ex. `CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS = [r"^/api/", r"/webhooks/.*"]` -- but consider first whether the view still needs CSRF exemption under the new implementation)
- Replace `HTTPS_REDIRECT_EXEMPT` with `HTTPS_REDIRECT_EXEMPT_PATHS` and ensure patterns include leading slash (ex. `[r"^/health$", r"/api/internal/.*"]`)
- Remove all CSRF cookie and token related settings - the new implementation doesn't use cookies or tokens (ex. `{{ csrf_input }}` and `{{ csrf_token }}`)

## [0.57.0](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/releases/plain@0.57.0) (2025-08-15)

### What's changed

- The `RedirectView.permanent` attribute has been replaced with `status_code` for more flexible redirect status codes ([12dda16](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/12dda16731))
- Updated `RedirectView` initialization parameters: `url_name` replaces `pattern_name`, `preserve_query_params` replaces `query_string`, and removed 410 Gone functionality ([3b9ca71](https://github.com/dropseed/plain/commit/3b9ca713bf))

### Upgrade instructions

- Replace `ResponsePermanentRedirect` imports with `ResponseRedirect` and pass `status_code=301` to the constructor
- Update `RedirectView` subclasses to use `status_code=301` instead of `permanent=True`
- Replace `pattern_name` with `url_name` in RedirectView usage
- Replace `query_string=True` with `preserve_query_params=True` in RedirectView usage

### Upgrade instructions

- Update any scripts or documentation that call `plain urls …`:
    - Replace `plain urls --flat` with `plain urls list --flat`
- If you invoke preflight checks in CI or locally:
    - Replace `plain preflight --database <alias>` (or multiple aliases) with the new boolean flag: `plain preflight --database`
- In `settings.py` migrate to the new database configuration:

    ```python
    # Before
    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "plain.backends.sqlite3",
            "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
        }
    }

    # After
    DATABASE = {
        "ENGINE": "plain.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
    }
    ```

    Remove any `DATABASES` and `DATABASE_ROUTERS` settings – they are no longer read.
