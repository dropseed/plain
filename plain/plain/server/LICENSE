Plain HTTP Server - License and Attribution
============================================

This module is based on gunicorn (https://gunicorn.org), integrated from
commit 1dc4ce9d59c3458305d701c4c6d63aa6b1d1b309 (gunicorn 23.0.0, October 2024).

The gunicorn code has been integrated into Plain and modified for Plain's
