# Plain Framework

Plain is a Python web framework.

- Always use `uv run` to execute commands — never use bare `python` or `plain` directly.
- Plain is a Django fork but has different APIs — never assume Django patterns will work.
- When unsure about an API or something doesn't work, run `uv run plain docs <package>` first. Add `--api` if you need the full API surface.
- Use the `/plain-install` skill to add new Plain packages.
- Use the `/plain-upgrade` skill to upgrade Plain packages.
- Use the `/plain-optimize` skill to investigate slow pages and N+1 queries.

## Coding style

- **Painfully obvious over clever** — blatant clarity, even if it means more code. You should _see_ what is happening, not have to deduce it.
- **Write code meant to be read** — clear names, natural flow, obvious structure. The next person reading it should understand it immediately.
- **Simplify to the present need** — if it feels overcomplicated, it is. Get right to the heart of the issue.

## Settings

Settings live in `app/settings.py` and are accessed via `plain.runtime.settings`.

- Type-annotated settings can be set via `PLAIN_`-prefixed environment variables (e.g., `PLAIN_SECRET_KEY`, `PLAIN_DEBUG=true`). Env vars take highest precedence — they override `settings.py` values. When suggesting how to configure a setting, mention the env var option.
- `uv run plain settings list` — list all settings with current values and sources
- `uv run plain settings get <SETTING_NAME>` — get a specific setting's value

- Never use `getattr(settings, "X", default)` — all known settings have defaults registered by their packages, so `settings.X` always works. Using `getattr` masks typos and missing package installs.

Run `uv run plain docs runtime` for full details on env var syntax, `.env` files, custom prefixes, and package settings.

## Key Differences from Django

Plain is a Django fork but has different APIs. Package-specific differences are in their respective rules (plain-postgres, plain-templates) under a `## Differences from Django` section. These are the core framework differences:

- **URLs**: Use `Router` with `urls` list, not Django's `urlpatterns`
- **Request data**: Use `request.query_params` not `request.GET`, `request.form_data` not `request.POST`, `request.json_data` not `json.loads(request.body)`, `request.files` not `request.FILES`
- **Middleware**: Middleware uses `before_request(self, request) -> Response | None` and `after_response(self, request, response) -> Response` — not Django's `__init__(self, get_response)` / `__call__` pattern. No `AuthMiddleware` exists — auth works through sessions + view-level checks (`AuthViewMixin`).

When in doubt, run `uv run plain docs <package> --api` to check the actual API.

## Logging

- **Message format**: Capitalized sentence fragments — `"User logged in"`, `"Payment failed"`, not snake_case tokens or inline key=value
- **No f-strings or % formatting** in log messages — pass variable data via `context={}` instead
- Use `context={}` for `app_logger`, `extra={"context": {...}}` for standard loggers (`logging.getLogger("plain.xxx")`)

Run `uv run plain docs logs` for full examples and anti-patterns.

## OTel exception observability

OTel-based exception tooling (Datadog/NR/Honeycomb-style) attributes application errors to **entry spans** — the topmost span belonging to the service for a given unit of work. The convention across APM backends is:

```
span_kind IN (SERVER, CONSUMER, PRODUCER) AND status_code = 'ERROR' AND has(events.name, 'exception')
```

Only those three span kinds count for error attribution. `INTERNAL` and `CLIENT` are trace context — they explain what was happening, but they're not where the failure is recorded.

**Pick the right `SpanKind` when adding instrumentation:**

- `SERVER` — incoming requests (HTTP, RPC handlers, etc.)
- `CONSUMER` — discrete background units of work (jobs, chores, scheduled tasks)
- `PRODUCER` — emitting work to a queue/broker
- `CLIENT` — outgoing calls (DB, HTTP, SMTP) — never an error-attribution boundary
- `INTERNAL` — sub-operations and inner loop cycles (worker tick, template render) — useful for trace context, not error attribution

If a failure inside an `INTERNAL`/`CLIENT` span is a real application error, the surrounding entry span should carry the failure. If there's no entry span and the failure matters, you probably need to add one.

The canonical failure signal on an entry span is `status_code=ERROR` + `error.type` attribute + a recorded exception event. Don't branch on `exception.escaped` — deprecated upstream, unreliable in the Python SDK.

If the surrounding code catches the exception inside the `with span:` block, the SDK's auto-record on context exit won't fire — stamp the canonical signal explicitly:

```python
span.record_exception(exc)
span.set_status(trace.StatusCode.ERROR)
span.set_attribute(ERROR_TYPE, format_exception_type(exc))
```

If the exception propagates out of the span context, the SDK auto-records and sets status — only `error.type` needs to be set explicitly.

**Already wired entry spans:**

- HTTP requests — SERVER (`plain/internal/handlers/base.py`)
- View 5xx attachment — `plain/views/base.py:_respond_to_exception` (records on the SERVER span via `_finalize_span`)
- Job enqueue — PRODUCER (`plain-jobs/jobs/jobs.py`)
- Job execute — CONSUMER (`plain-jobs/jobs/models.py`), plus a fallback CONSUMER span in `plain-jobs/jobs/workers.py:process_job` that catches lookup-time failures before `run()` is reached
- Worker maintenance loop — CONSUMER (`plain-jobs/jobs/workers.py`), opened only on ticks where a maintenance task is due — fully idle ticks emit no spans at all
- Worker claim/heartbeat failures — one-off `claim job` / `worker heartbeat` CONSUMER error spans via `emit_error_consumer_span` (`plain-jobs/jobs/otel.py`); the claim transaction, heartbeat writes, gauge queries, and done-callback bookkeeping are otherwise untraced (`plain.postgres.otel.suppress_db_tracing`)
- Chore execution — CONSUMER (`plain/cli/chores.py`)
- MCP RPC dispatch — SERVER (`plain-mcp/mcp/views.py`)

Trace-context-only (not error attribution): template render (`plain-templates`), DB queries / email sends (CLIENT — same role).

## Documentation

**Discovery** — find what's available and where things are:

- `uv run plain docs --list` — all packages and core modules with descriptions
- `uv run plain docs --search <term>` — find which modules/sections mention a term (compact, one line per section). Substring by default; add `--regex` for regex patterns (alternation, anchors, etc.)

**Reading** — get full content:

- `uv run plain docs <name>` — full markdown docs
- `uv run plain docs <name> --search <term>` — full content of all matching sections in that module
- `uv run plain docs <name> --api` — public API surface (classes, functions, signatures)

**Workflow**: Use `--search <term>` to find which module has what you need, then read the full doc, or run `<name> --search <term>` to print just the matching sections.

## CLI Quick Reference

- `uv run plain check` — run linting, preflight, migration, and test checks (add `--skip-test` for faster iteration)
- `uv run plain pre-commit` — `check` plus commit-specific steps (custom commands, uv lock, build)
- `uv run plain shell` — interactive Python REPL with the app configured (`-c "..."` for one-off code, piped stdin works). For standalone scripts, put `import plain.runtime; plain.runtime.setup()` at the top and run with `uv run python script.py`.
- `uv run plain request /path` — test HTTP request against the dev database (`--user`, `--method`, `--data`, `--header`, `--status`, `--contains`, `--not-contains`). Add `--json` for context-frugal output — response metadata and trace analysis (query counts, N+1s, span tree), no response body.

## Debugging and verifying changes

Don't guess at errors — reproduce them first, read the traceback, then fix what it actually says.

- `uv run plain check` — lint, preflight, migration, and test checks in one shot (add `--skip-test` for faster iteration)
- `uv run plain request /path` — hit a view and see the full error/stacktrace (`--user`, `--status`, `--contains`, `--not-contains`)
- `uv run plain shell -c "..."` — run a quick snippet to test behavior in isolation
- `uv run plain test -x -k test_name` — run a specific failing test, stop on first failure
- `print()` statements — add them, run the code, read the output, then remove before committing
